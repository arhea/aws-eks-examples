# EKS Demos

_Disclaimer: This code is for demo purposes only and should not be treated as production ready._

This repository is a set of demos that I use to demonstrate and test the capabilities of EKS. The most up to date source of learning EKS is the [eksworkshop.com](https://eksworkshop.com). This workshop will contain information and starting places for configurations.
